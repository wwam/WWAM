These are the ICO contracts without import directives.
For some reason, it's impossible to verify a contract using import directives on etherscan.io. We had to make one-pager contracts to be able to verify the contract code on etherscan.
That provides a simple way for anyone to verify that the contract source code is the same as the one published, as well as making the contract interactable with on etherscan.io.
Those are the actual contracts that are deployed on the Ethereum network.

For readability purpose, we left the proper source code using import directives in the parent directory.
